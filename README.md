# Streamlit Dashboard Enhanced

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a Streamlit dashboard to visualize and explore school learning modalities data from the **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)** for 2021. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations, metrics, and a data table to provide insights into the educational modalities during the 2020-2021 academic year.

  - Cleans the dataset by converting date fields and standardizing zip code formats.
